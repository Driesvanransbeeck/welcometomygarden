<h3>1. ‍Who can register on the platform?</h3>
<p>
  <span class="bold">
    Any citizen who wants to offer a free camping spot in their garden to slow travellers and any
    slow travellers (cyclists and hikers) who want to use the network.
  </span>
  If you want to add your garden or contact a host, you need to create an account. Only registered
  participants can be active users. You can register with your email address.
</p>
<p>
  The creation of an account by a user does not give this user ownership over the account. Welcome
  To My Garden reserves the right to refuse, suspend or delete accounts, for example if the user
  does not comply with the following rules or inappropriate behaviour has been reported by a host or
  guest.
</p>
<span class="important">Each account must comply with the following rules‍</span>
<ol>
  <li class="rule">
    <h4>Every account is strictly personal</h4>
    <p>
      Each account must be unique and linked to a natural person. If you register for an account,
      you must provide accurate account information and promptly update this information if it
      changes. Every user has the right to create one account. If it is determined that one person
      has multiple accounts, Welcome To My Garden reserves the right to delete all these accounts.
      Every user must be over 16 years old.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="rule">
    <h4>An account cannot be transferred to another person</h4>
    <p>
      Since each account is strictly linked to one specific person, this account cannot be
      transferred to another person without the permission of Welcome To My Garden. This transfer
      ban must be considered in the broadest sense. Welcome To My Garden reserves the right to
      refuse or delete this account in case of infringements.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="rule">
    <h4>An account cannot be used for commercial purposes</h4>
    <p>
      The Welcome To My Garden platform is intended to enable citizens to offer their gardens as
      free camping spots and to enable slow travellers to use the network while travelling. An
      account can therefore only be used for these purposes. Any use of the account for the sole
      purpose of enjoying a commercial advantage is strictly prohibited.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="rule">
    <h4>The account information must always remain confidential</h4>
    <p>
      It is not allowed for any other person than the actual person who created the account, to use
      this account. The person who created the account must ensure that (s)he keeps the password and
      login details safe. We strongly advise you to use a "strong" password (a password with a
      combination of lowercase, uppercase letters and numbers). We advise you to use a password
      manager. Welcome To My Garden can under no circumstances be held responsible for any loss or
      damage incurred to the account if the above conditions are not met by the user. Welcome To My
      Garden cannot be held responsible for theft of your account, by 'phishing' for example,
      either. Welcome To My Garden will never ask its users for personal data such as a login or
      password via email. If personal data is requested, the user will always be redirected to the
      platform of Welcome To My Garden. You are responsible for all activities that occur in
      connection with your account and accept all risks of unauthorized access.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>‍Offensive behaviour</h4>
    <p>
      We firmly believe in freedom of speech. However, in order to ensure that the platform can be

      Violent threats (direct or indirect): You may not threaten or promote violence. This includes
      the promotion of terrorism. Harassment: You may not incite to or be involved in deliberately
      insulting or harassing others. Here are some factors that we can take into account when
      assessing abusive behaviour: whether the main purpose of the reported account is harassing or
      sending offensive messages to others; whether the reported behaviour is unidirectional or
      contains threats; whether the reported account encourages others to intimidate another
      account; and whether the reported account sends intimidating messages to an account from
      multiple accounts. Hatred: You may not promote violence against other people or directly
      attack or threaten them on the basis of race, ethnic background, nationality, sexual
      orientation, gender, gender identity, philosophical affiliation, religion, age, disability or
      illness. We also do not allow accounts whose main purpose is to incite others to do harm on
      the basis of these categories. Misuse of multiple accounts: Creating multiple accounts for
      overlapping use to avoid temporary or permanent suspension of an individual account is not
      allowed. Private data: You may not publish or post confidential data and private information
      of others without their express authorization and consent. These data include but are not
      limited to: credit card numbers, address details, telephone numbers or data that fall under
      the personal privacy of a person. Impersonation: You are not allowed to access the platform
      pretending to be someone else and specifically you may not deceive, confuse or threaten other
      users in this way. You may not be allowed to enter via the platform if someone else deceives,
