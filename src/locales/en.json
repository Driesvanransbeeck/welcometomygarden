Also, WTMG is all about tents, not beds. You could consider it the outdoor version of Couchsurfing. There is a commercial initiative called Campspace in the Netherlands which does more or less the same thing as WTMG, but you have to pay for your camping spot. WTMG is a free initiative, and you don’t need to pay your host for your stay."
